# Motivation

The principal objective of this website project was to have a central place where I could showcase the results of the races virtual racing series and all the info the potential drivers would need before joining the series. I haven't uploaded the project from it's start, but it's about at version 1.2 right now. I'll try to keep track of that for the next updates, the next big one is coming soon to prepare everything for the new 2021 season in february.
